                <h3>Essay theme: The Blockchain</h3>
                <p class="left-page"> Society is always evolving and creating new things to satisfy its needs. One such example is currency – ages ago people used to trade items for items directly as a way to survive. This concept developed further and physical money came to be. Gold and silver coins were popular throughout the ages, which got gradually replaced by paper money. With how popular the internet has gotten, the dawn of the blockchain and cryptocurrency is on the horizon.A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and often public, digital ledger consisting of records called blocks that is used to record transactions across many computers. The trick is that no involved block can be altered retroactively, without the changing of all subsequent blocks. Blocks hold batches of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded. They also include the cryptographic hash of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two. The linked blocks form a chain. This iterative process confirms the integrity of the previous block.Blockchain is the technology that enables cryptocurrency. Crypto does not exist in physical form and it is decentralized, meaning it is not connected to a central authority or government.It is no wonder that cryptocurrency is going to change our lives. Before it has gone mainstream, many people such as myself have invested (or are investing) in it due to a growing demand and </p>

                    therefore opportunity for making profit. 
                    Since it is also has no physical form, it is harder to steal and easier to keep track of. A study has shown that transactions made with criminally derived physical money are five times more common that with crypto.Another example of its influence is the infamous “GPU shortage” that happened in 2017 and is reoccurring now. Due to the great demand for cryptocurrency a “bull market” is created and prices skyrocket.
                    This led to an increase in cryptocurrency mining and increased the demand for graphics cards. Popular favorites of cryptocurrency miners such as Nvidia's GTX 1060 and GTX 1070 doubled or tripled in price – or were out of stock. Because of this gamers and computer science students suffered and were (still are) unable to build systems, as graphics cards are not available.To sum up, the arrival of the blockchain has enabled cryptocurrencies, which are becoming increasingly more popular. It is estimated that by 2030 society will have moved on from physical money, but it is still hard to predict the impact that this would have on the economy and our everyday lives.
